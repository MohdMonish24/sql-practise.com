This repository is dedicated to students and professionals who would like to brush up and advance their SQL skills for their careers. I found (https://www.sql-practice.com) educational and the web site user friendly however there wasnâ€™t the complete solution book shared on the web site neither on GitHub. So now you can get the answers with alternative solutions for each question 

I have used PostgreSQL as main Database Management Systems (DBMS) and therefore you may encounter some queries that work in PostgreSQL may not work in
other DBMS such as SQL Server or MySQL as some implementations slight vary in syntax. For such cases, for example, in date and time operations 
I included standart SQL queries as well.

I populated mockdata using www.mockaroo.com to effectively practise the queries and get some output while working locally. Note that it is not the same large dataset used on the web site, so I suggest you use the web site itself as long as you have internet connection, which is also good for tracking your progress. You may use the sql database files given in the repository for convenience and a rapid start in creating schemas and inserting datasets.

The hospital test contains 50 questions and consists of 3 category:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

You can use the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to figure out what data to store, the entities, their attributes and also how entities 
relate to other entities.
